Spent 3 days stuck on downloading RedolentSun

ran into this error for a while

Errno 26 text file busy
opt/mhn/env/bin/python

Unfortunately, it would start hanging every time it finished after it finished installing its 9000 rules. I even left it downloading for several hours and it made no progress.
